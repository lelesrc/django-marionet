DJANGO-MARIONET

Marionet for Django.

== Testing
Django and django-portlets should be installed to the system. Unless django-portlets is in <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt>,
create a symlink 'portlets' to the project root directory, pointing to <tt>django-portlets/portlets</tt> directory.

Django-portlets can be cloned here:
  hg clone https://lamikae@bitbucket.org/lamikae/django-portlets/

To run the full test suite for both marionet and django-portlets, run <tt>make test</tt>.
